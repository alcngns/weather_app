# weather_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

I Developed a Weather App with Flutter! ‚òÄÔ∏èüå°Ô∏è
Today I want to talk about an exciting project of mine! I have completed my weather app using Flutter. üöÄ

In this project, I used the Dio library to pull weather data from a website's API. After successfully pulling the data from the API in JSON format, I used Card widgets to present this information in a user-friendly interface.
During this process, I had the opportunity to get to know the powerful structure of Flutter more closely and improved myself in API integration and data visualization.

I am very happy about this experience, which also motivates me for my future projects and contributes to my learning process.

If you would like to get more information about my project or give feedback, please feel free!
